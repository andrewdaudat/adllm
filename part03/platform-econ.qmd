# Platform Economics and Two-Sided Markets

## Chapter Introduction

When a user asks ChatGPT "What's the best restaurant near me?" and receives a response that seamlessly integrates recommendations with sponsored content from OpenTable, Yelp, or local restaurants, they are participating in a complex two-sided market ecosystem. On one side, users seek valuable information and services; on the other side, advertisers compete to reach these users. The LLM platform sits in the middle, serving as both facilitator and intermediary, capturing value while creating it for both sides.

This multi-sided platform structure fundamentally alters how we think about mechanism design. Unlike traditional single-sided auctions where the auctioneer simply maximizes revenue from bidders, LLM platforms must balance the welfare of multiple distinct participant groups whose interactions create network effects. A mechanism that extracts maximum short-term revenue from advertisers may drive away users, ultimately destroying the platform's value proposition. Conversely, focusing solely on user experience while ignoring advertiser needs leads to unsustainable business models.

The challenge becomes even more complex when we consider the dynamic nature of these relationships. Users develop expectations about content quality and advertising integration over time. Advertisers learn and adapt their strategies based on platform policies and competitor behavior. The platform itself evolves its capabilities, policies, and monetization approaches. These co-evolutionary dynamics create rich strategic environments that traditional mechanism design theory, developed for static single-sided markets, struggles to address.

**Learning Objectives:** By the end of this chapter, you will:

1. Understand the fundamental economic principles governing two-sided and multi-sided markets
2. Analyze how network effects and platform dynamics affect mechanism design choices
3. Master the theoretical frameworks for platform competition and differentiation
4. Design mechanisms that account for cross-side externalities and feedback effects
5. Apply platform economics insights to optimize LLM advertising mechanisms
6. Analyze regulatory challenges and policy implications for dominant platforms

**Chapter Roadmap:** We begin with intuitive examples of platform economics in digital markets, then develop formal models of two-sided markets with network effects. The mathematical treatment covers platform pricing strategies, competition dynamics, and welfare analysis. We conclude with applications to LLM advertising platforms, including platform differentiation strategies and regulatory considerations.

**Connection to Multi-Objective LLM Advertising:** This chapter provides the economic foundation for understanding why LLM platforms face multi-objective optimization problems. The tension between user welfare and advertiser revenue is not merely a design choice—it emerges naturally from the platform's role in facilitating two-sided markets. The framework developed here will inform optimal platform strategies and mechanism design choices for your thesis research.

## Intuitive Development: Platform Economics in Practice

### The Two-Sided Market Structure

Traditional markets involve buyers and sellers of the same product or service. Two-sided markets introduce an intermediary platform that facilitates interactions between two distinct groups, where the value to each group depends on participation from the other group.

**Classic Examples:**

- **Credit Cards:** Merchants want platforms with many consumers; consumers want platforms accepted by many merchants
- **Operating Systems:** Users want platforms with many applications; developers want platforms with many users
- **Dating Apps:** Each gender wants platforms with many participants of the opposite gender
- **Gaming Consoles:** Gamers want consoles with many games; developers want consoles with many gamers

**LLM Advertising as Two-Sided Market:** LLM platforms create value by connecting two distinct groups:

- **Users:** Seek information, assistance, and services from AI systems
- **Advertisers:** Seek access to users for marketing and customer acquisition

The platform's value to users depends partly on the quality and relevance of advertising (high-quality ads provide useful information), while the platform's value to advertisers depends entirely on access to engaged users.

### Network Effects and Platform Value

The defining characteristic of platform markets is the presence of _network effects_—the value to one participant increases with the number of participants on the same side (_direct network effects_) or the other side (_indirect network effects_).

**Direct Network Effects in LLM Platforms:**

- **User-to-User:** More users generate more queries, improving the LLM's training data and capabilities
- **Advertiser-to-Advertiser:** More advertisers create competitive auctions, potentially improving platform revenue and mechanism efficiency

**Indirect Network Effects (Cross-Side):**

- **Users Benefit from Advertisers:** More advertisers mean more relevant sponsored content, better product discovery, and platform sustainability
- **Advertisers Benefit from Users:** More users provide larger audiences, better targeting opportunities, and more valuable attention

**Example: ChatGPT's Network Effects** When ChatGPT gains more users:

1. **Direct User Benefits:** Enhanced model performance through more diverse interactions
2. **Advertiser Attraction:** Larger audience attracts more advertisers, increasing auction competition
3. **Quality Improvement:** Higher advertising revenue funds better models and infrastructure
4. **Feedback Loop:** Better performance attracts more users, creating virtuous cycle

### The Platform's Chicken-and-Egg Problem

New platforms face a fundamental challenge: users won't join without valuable content/services, but content providers won't join without users.

**Cold Start Strategies for LLM Platforms:**

1. **Subsidize One Side:** Offer free premium services to users while charging advertisers
2. **Create Initial Value:** Develop strong standalone capabilities (like GPT's language abilities) before adding advertising
3. **Exclusive Content:** Secure exclusive advertiser partnerships to differentiate the platform
4. **Freemium Models:** Provide basic services free, charge for premium features

**Example: Platform Launch Strategy**

```
LaunchStrategy:
    Phase 1: Build user base with free, high-quality AI services
    Phase 2: Introduce minimal, high-quality advertising to sustain operations
    Phase 3: Scale advertising while maintaining user experience quality
    Phase 4: Optimize multi-objective mechanisms for sustainable growth
```

### Platform Differentiation and Competition

Unlike traditional businesses that compete primarily on price and quality, platforms compete on network size, ecosystem quality, and strategic positioning.

**Differentiation Strategies:**

1. **Quality Focus:** Superior AI capabilities, better user experience, higher-quality advertising integration
2. **Niche Targeting:** Specialized for specific domains (medical, legal, creative) with relevant advertiser ecosystems
3. **Privacy/Trust:** Emphasize data protection and user control over advertising
4. **Integration:** Seamless connection with other services and platforms

**Competitive Dynamics Example:** Consider competition between ChatGPT and Google's Bard:

- **ChatGPT Strategy:** Focus on conversational quality, creative tasks, minimal advertising
- **Bard Strategy:** Leverage Google's search ecosystem, extensive advertiser relationships, integrated services
- **Result:** Different equilibrium positions rather than head-to-head competition

### Platform Pricing and Monetization

Two-sided platforms face complex pricing decisions because they must balance the interests of multiple participant groups.

**Traditional Pricing Principles Break Down:**

- **Cost-Plus Pricing:** Platforms create value through facilitation, not production
- **Marginal Cost Pricing:** Digital platforms have near-zero marginal costs
- **Single-Sided Optimization:** Must consider effects on both sides of the market

**Platform Pricing Strategies:**

1. **Membership Fees:** Fixed charges for platform access (ChatGPT Plus subscriptions)
2. **Transaction Fees:** Percentage of each interaction (advertising auction fees)
3. **Freemium Models:** Free basic access, premium features require payment
4. **Cross-Subsidization:** Use profits from one side to subsidize the other

**LLM Platform Revenue Sources:**

```
PlatformRevenue:
    DirectUserPayments: Subscription fees, premium features
    AdvertisingRevenue: Auction-based advertising, sponsored content
    DataMonetization: Insights and analytics (privacy-compliant)
    APIAccess: Third-party developers and integrations
    EnterpriseServices: Custom solutions for business clients
```

### Multi-Homing and Platform Switching

Unlike traditional markets where customers typically choose one supplier, platform markets often allow _multi-homing_—participants can use multiple platforms simultaneously.

**Multi-Homing Effects:**

- **Reduced Network Effects:** If users and advertisers spread across multiple platforms, individual platform value decreases
- **Increased Competition:** Platforms must differentiate beyond just network size
- **Strategic Complexity:** Participants optimize across multiple platform relationships

**LLM Platform Multi-Homing:**

- **Users:** May use ChatGPT for creative tasks, Claude for analysis, Bard for search-related queries
- **Advertisers:** May advertise across multiple LLM platforms with different strategies
- **Implications:** Platforms cannot rely solely on lock-in effects

### Regulatory and Policy Considerations

Platform markets raise unique regulatory challenges due to network effects, market concentration, and cross-side externalities.

**Key Regulatory Concerns:**

1. **Market Concentration:** Network effects can lead to winner-take-all outcomes
2. **Data Privacy:** Platforms collect extensive data from both sides
3. **Content Moderation:** Platforms control information flow and advertising content
4. **Fair Access:** Ensuring equitable access for all participants
5. **Innovation Incentives:** Balancing platform profits with innovation promotion

**LLM-Specific Regulatory Issues:**

- **AI Safety:** Ensuring responsible AI development and deployment
- **Content Authenticity:** Managing AI-generated content and advertising
- **Bias and Fairness:** Preventing discriminatory outcomes in advertising
- **Competition Policy:** Preventing anti-competitive use of AI capabilities

## Mathematical Foundations: Two-Sided Market Theory

### Basic Two-Sided Market Model

Consider a platform facilitating interactions between two groups: users (indexed by $u$) and advertisers (indexed by $a$). Let $n_u$ and $n_a$ denote the number of participants on each side.

**Utility Functions:** Each user $u$ receives utility: $$U_u = v_u - p_u + \alpha_u f(n_a)$$

where:

- $v_u$: intrinsic value from platform services
- $p_u$: price paid to platform
- $\alpha_u$: strength of cross-side network effects from advertisers
- $f(n_a)$: network effect function (typically increasing and concave)

Each advertiser $a$ receives utility: $$U_a = w_a g(n_u) - p_a$$

where:

- $w_a$: value per user reached
- $g(n_u)$: network effect function from users
- $p_a$: price paid to platform

**Platform Profit:** The platform maximizes: $$\Pi = n_u p_u + n_a p_a - C(n_u, n_a)$$

where $C(n_u, n_a)$ represents the cost of serving both sides.

### Equilibrium Analysis

**Definition 11.1 (Two-Sided Market Equilibrium).** A two-sided market equilibrium is a tuple $(n_u^*, n_a^*, p_u^*, p_a^*)$ such that:

1. Each participant's utility is maximized given prices and participation levels
2. Platform profit is maximized given participation responses
3. Markets clear: demand equals capacity constraints

**Participation Decisions:** Users participate if $U_u \geq 0$, so the marginal user satisfies: $$v_u^{\text{marginal}} = p_u - \alpha_u f(n_a)$$

Similarly, advertisers participate if: $$w_a^{\text{marginal}} g(n_u) = p_a$$

**Theorem 11.2 (Existence of Equilibrium).** Under standard assumptions (concave network effects, heterogeneous participants, bounded valuations), a two-sided market equilibrium exists.

_Proof Sketch._ The proof uses fixed-point arguments. Define reaction functions $R_u(n_a, p_u)$ and $R_a(n_u, p_a)$ giving optimal participation levels. Under concavity and boundedness, these functions are well-behaved, and Brouwer's fixed-point theorem guarantees existence. □

### Optimal Platform Pricing

The platform's pricing problem involves balancing the trade-off between higher prices (increased revenue per participant) and lower participation (reduced network effects).

**First-Order Conditions:** Taking derivatives of platform profit with respect to prices:

$$\frac{\partial \Pi}{\partial p_u} = n_u + p_u \frac{\partial n_u}{\partial p_u} + p_a \frac{\partial n_a}{\partial p_u} - \frac{\partial C}{\partial n_u} \frac{\partial n_u}{\partial p_u} - \frac{\partial C}{\partial n_a} \frac{\partial n_a}{\partial p_u} = 0$$

$$\frac{\partial \Pi}{\partial p_a} = n_a + p_a \frac{\partial n_a}{\partial p_a} + p_u \frac{\partial n_u}{\partial p_a} - \frac{\partial C}{\partial n_u} \frac{\partial n_u}{\partial p_a} - \frac{\partial C}{\partial n_a} \frac{\partial n_a}{\partial p_a} = 0$$

**Cross-Side Effects:** The key insight is that prices affect participation on both sides due to network effects. The terms $\frac{\partial n_a}{\partial p_u}$ and $\frac{\partial n_u}{\partial p_a}$ capture these cross-side externalities.

**Theorem 11.3 (Optimal Platform Pricing).** In the optimal pricing equilibrium:

$$p_u^* = MC_u - \frac{p_a^* \frac{\partial n_a}{\partial p_u}}{\frac{\partial n_u}{\partial p_u}}$$

$$p_a^* = MC_a - \frac{p_u^* \frac{\partial n_u}{\partial p_a}}{\frac{\partial n_a}{\partial p_a}}$$

where $MC_u$ and $MC_a$ are marginal costs of serving each side.

_Interpretation:_ Optimal prices can be below marginal cost if cross-side benefits are sufficiently large. The platform may subsidize one side to attract participants and benefit the other side.

### Network Effects and Market Structure

The strength of network effects fundamentally determines market structure and competitive dynamics.

**Definition 11.4 (Network Effect Intensity).** For side $i$, define network effect intensity as: $$\beta_i = \frac{n_{-i} f'(n_{-i})}{f(n_{-i})}$$

where $n_{-i}$ is participation on the other side.

**Theorem 11.5 (Network Effects and Market Concentration).** Markets with stronger network effects ($\beta_i > \beta^{\text{critical}}$) tend toward monopolization, while weaker network effects support multiple competing platforms.

_Proof Sketch._ Strong network effects create increasing returns to scale in platform value. Once a platform gains an advantage, it becomes increasingly attractive to both sides, creating a feedback loop that drives out competitors. The critical threshold $\beta^{\text{critical}}$ depends on product differentiation and multi-homing costs. □

### Platform Competition Model

Consider two platforms $P_1$ and $P_2$ competing for users and advertisers.

**Platform Differentiation:** Let $\theta_u$ and $\theta_a$ represent preference parameters for horizontal differentiation. Platform $P_1$ attracts users with parameter $\theta_u < \theta_u^*$ and advertisers with $\theta_a < \theta_a^*$.

**Competitive Equilibrium:** Each platform $i$ solves: $$\max_{p_{u,i}, p_{a,i}} \Pi_i = n_{u,i}(p_{u,1}, p_{u,2}, p_{a,1}, p_{a,2}) p_{u,i} + n_{a,i}(\cdot) p_{a,i}$$

**Theorem 11.6 (Platform Competition Equilibrium).** Under symmetric platforms with quadratic differentiation costs, the competitive equilibrium features:

1. Positive profits for both platforms (differentiated Bertrand competition)
2. Lower prices than monopoly case
3. Higher total welfare than monopoly

### Welfare Analysis in Two-Sided Markets

Social welfare in two-sided markets includes utilities from both sides plus platform profit.

**Social Welfare Function:** $$W = \int_0^{n_u} U_u du + \int_0^{n_a} U_a da + \Pi$$

**Theorem 11.7 (Platform vs. Social Optimum).** Platform optimal pricing generally differs from social optimum due to:

1. **Internalization Problem:** Platform doesn't fully internalize cross-side benefits
2. **Monopoly Markup:** Platform extracts rent through pricing power
3. **Network Externalities:** Participants don't internalize their effect on others' utility

**Welfare Analysis for LLM Platforms:**

```
WelfareComponents:
    UserSurplus: Value from AI services minus subscription costs
    AdvertiserSurplus: Value from user access minus advertising costs
    PlatformProfit: Revenue minus operational costs
    CrossSideExternalities: Network effects not internalized by participants
    QualityExternalities: Advertising impact on user experience
```

## Advanced Results: Platform Dynamics and Strategic Behavior

### Dynamic Platform Growth Models

Platform growth involves complex feedback loops between user acquisition, advertiser attraction, and quality improvement.

**Dynamic Growth Model:** Let $n_u(t)$ and $n_a(t)$ represent participation over time. The growth dynamics follow:

$$\frac{dn_u}{dt} = \lambda_u [V_u(n_a(t), q(t)) - p_u] n_u(t) - \delta_u n_u(t)$$

$$\frac{dn_a}{dt} = \lambda_a [W_a n_u(t) - p_a] n_a(t) - \delta_a n_a(t)$$

where $q(t)$ represents platform quality, $\lambda_i$ are growth rates, and $\delta_i$ are churn rates.

**Quality Evolution:** Platform quality improves with investment and network effects: $$\frac{dq}{dt} = \gamma I(t) + \mu f(n_u(t), n_a(t)) - \xi q(t)$$

where $I(t)$ is platform investment, $\gamma$ is investment effectiveness, $\mu$ captures learning from network interactions, and $\xi$ is quality depreciation.

**Theorem 11.8 (Platform Growth Dynamics).** Under appropriate conditions, the dynamic system has multiple equilibria:

1. **Death Spiral:** Low participation leads to quality degradation and further exits
2. **Successful Growth:** Network effects dominate, leading to sustainable expansion
3. **Stagnation:** Balanced forces result in stable but limited growth

### Strategic Behavior in Platform Markets

Participants in platform markets engage in sophisticated strategic behavior, considering both immediate payoffs and long-term platform evolution.

**Advertiser Strategic Considerations:**

- **Platform Investment:** Early participation in growing platforms vs. waiting for maturity
- **Portfolio Effects:** Multi-homing across platforms vs. platform-exclusive strategies
- **Quality Signaling:** Investing in high-quality ads to improve platform perception

**User Strategic Behavior:**

- **Platform Choice:** Selecting platforms based on expected advertising quality and quantity
- **Engagement Levels:** Modulating participation based on advertising experience
- **Switching Costs:** Considering lock-in effects from platform-specific data and preferences

**Platform Strategic Responses:**

**Definition 11.9 (Platform Strategy Space).** A platform strategy consists of:

- Pricing strategy: $(p_u(t), p_a(t))$
- Quality investment: $I(t)$
- Mechanism design: $M(t)$ (e.g., advertising auction parameters)
- Market positioning: Differentiation and targeting choices

**Theorem 11.10 (Strategic Equilibrium Existence).** In the dynamic platform competition game, Markov Perfect Equilibria exist under standard technical conditions.

### Multi-Objective Platform Optimization

LLM platforms face the multi-objective problem of balancing user satisfaction, advertiser value, and platform profitability.

**Multi-Objective Formulation:** $$\max_{\alpha \in [0,1]} \alpha \cdot \text{Revenue}(t) + (1-\alpha) \cdot \text{UserWelfare}(t)$$

subject to:

- **Participation Constraints:** Users and advertisers must find participation profitable
- **Quality Constraints:** Advertising integration must maintain service quality
- **Competition Constraints:** Strategies must be sustainable against competitor responses

**Dynamic Trade-off Evolution:** The optimal $\alpha$ parameter changes over platform lifecycle:

```
PlatformLifecycle:
    Launch Phase: α ≈ 0 (prioritize user acquisition and experience)
    Growth Phase: α ≈ 0.3 (balance growth with initial monetization)
    Maturity Phase: α ≈ 0.6 (optimize revenue while maintaining position)
    Defense Phase: α varies (adapt to competitive threats)
```

**Theorem 11.11 (Optimal Dynamic Trade-off).** The optimal trade-off parameter $\alpha^*(t)$ satisfies:

$$\frac{d\alpha^*}{dt} = \kappa \left[ \frac{\partial W}{\partial \alpha} - \lambda \frac{\partial^2 W}{\partial \alpha \partial t} \right]$$

where $W$ is total platform value, $\kappa$ is adjustment speed, and $\lambda$ reflects forward-looking optimization.

### Platform Ecosystem Effects

LLM platforms exist within broader technology ecosystems, creating complex interdependencies.

**Ecosystem Interactions:**

- **API Economy:** Third-party developers building on platform capabilities
- **Data Partnerships:** Integration with external data sources and services
- **Hardware Dependencies:** Relationship with cloud providers and chip manufacturers
- **Regulatory Environment:** Response to policy changes and compliance requirements

**Network of Networks Model:** Consider platform $P$ embedded in ecosystem $E$ with connections to other platforms $\{P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_k\}$.

The platform's value becomes: $$V_P = V_{\text{standalone}} + \sum_{i=1}^k \beta_i V_{P_i} + \gamma V_E$$

where $\beta_i$ captures inter-platform synergies and $\gamma$ represents ecosystem effects.

**Theorem 11.12 (Ecosystem Equilibrium).** In multi-platform ecosystems, equilibrium strategies exhibit:

1. **Complementarity:** Platforms may cooperate in some dimensions while competing in others
2. **Specialization:** Each platform optimizes for specific niches within the ecosystem
3. **Co-evolution:** Platform strategies adapt jointly to ecosystem changes

## Chapter Synthesis

This chapter has established the economic foundations for understanding LLM advertising platforms as sophisticated two-sided markets with complex network effects, competitive dynamics, and regulatory considerations. The key insights that emerge are fundamental to designing effective multi-objective mechanisms for these platforms.

**Two-Sided Market Structure as Core Reality:** LLM advertising platforms cannot be understood through traditional single-sided market analysis. The interdependence between user and advertiser participation creates unique strategic challenges and opportunities that fundamentally shape optimal mechanism design. This two-sided structure explains why platforms face genuine multi-objective optimization problems—optimizing solely for advertiser revenue destroys user value, while ignoring advertiser needs makes the platform unsustainable.

**Network Effects as Strategic Assets:** The cross-side network effects between users and advertisers represent the primary source of platform value and competitive advantage. These effects create virtuous cycles where growth on one side attracts participation on the other side, but they also create vulnerability during platform launch and competitive threats. Understanding and strengthening these network effects must be central to any platform strategy.

**Dynamic Optimization Requirements:** Platform optimization is inherently dynamic. The optimal balance between user welfare and advertiser revenue evolves as the platform grows, competition intensifies, and market conditions change. Static mechanisms, no matter how well-designed, cannot adapt to these changing conditions. This reinforces the importance of the learning mechanisms developed in Chapter 10.

**Competition Through Differentiation:** Platform competition differs fundamentally from traditional product competition. Platforms compete on network effects, ecosystem quality, and strategic positioning rather than just price and features. This creates opportunities for multiple platforms to coexist by serving different market segments or providing different value propositions.

**Regulatory Complexity:** The unique characteristics of platform markets—network effects, data collection, content control—create novel regulatory challenges. Successful platforms must anticipate and adapt to evolving regulatory requirements while maintaining their competitive advantages and growth trajectories.

**Connection to Previous Chapters:** This chapter builds on the mechanism design foundations (Chapters 1-4) by explaining why LLM platforms naturally face multi-objective optimization problems. It extends the multi-objective optimization theory (Chapters 6-7) by providing the economic rationale for why these trade-offs exist and how they should be balanced. It complements the computational aspects (Chapter 9) and learning mechanisms (Chapter 10) by explaining the strategic environment in which these tools must operate.

**Forward Connection to Your Thesis:** The platform economics framework developed here directly informs your thesis research on multi-objective mechanism design for LLM advertising:

1. **Problem Justification:** The two-sided market structure explains why revenue-quality trade-offs are inherent to LLM platforms, not design choices

2. **Dynamic Optimization:** Platform lifecycle considerations suggest how the optimal α parameter in segment auctions should evolve over time

3. **Network Effect Integration:** The analysis suggests how to incorporate cross-side network effects into mechanism design and evaluation

4. **Competitive Strategy:** Understanding platform competition helps evaluate how mechanism choices affect competitive positioning

5. **Welfare Analysis:** The multi-sided welfare framework provides tools for evaluating the social impact of different mechanism designs

**Research Opportunities:** Several important questions emerge from this platform economics perspective:

1. **Mechanism Design for Network Effects:** How should auction mechanisms be modified to account for cross-side network effects and their dynamics?

2. **Platform Lifecycle Optimization:** What is the optimal evolution of mechanism parameters as platforms grow and mature?

3. **Multi-Platform Competition:** How do mechanism design choices affect competitive dynamics when users and advertisers can multi-home?

4. **Regulatory Mechanism Design:** How can platforms design mechanisms that are robust to regulatory changes while maintaining effectiveness?

**Practical Implications:** The platform economics analysis provides concrete guidance for LLM advertising platform design:

- **Launch Strategy:** Focus initially on user acquisition and experience (low α) to build network effects
- **Growth Strategy:** Gradually increase revenue focus (higher α) as network effects strengthen
- **Competitive Response:** Adjust mechanism parameters based on competitive positioning needs
- **Regulatory Preparation:** Design mechanisms with transparency and fairness considerations from the outset

**Integration with Multi-Objective Framework:** The platform economics perspective transforms the multi-objective optimization problem from a static engineering choice to a dynamic strategic necessity. The tension between revenue and quality is not just about balancing competing objectives—it reflects the fundamental challenge of creating sustainable value in two-sided markets while maintaining competitive advantage.

This economic foundation ensures that your thesis work on multi-objective mechanism design addresses real strategic challenges faced by LLM platforms, making your contributions both theoretically sound and practically valuable for the emerging AI advertising industry.

## Exercises

### Basic Exercises

**Exercise 11.1:** Consider a simple two-sided market model for an LLM platform.

- (a) Users have utility $U_u = 10 - p_u + 2\sqrt{n_a}$ and advertisers have utility $U_a = 5n_u - p_a$. Find the equilibrium participation levels when the platform sets prices $p_u = 3$ and $p_a = 100$.
- (b) Calculate the platform's profit in this equilibrium.
- (c) How would the equilibrium change if the platform reduced $p_u$ to 2? Analyze the cross-side effects.

**Exercise 11.2:** Network effects and platform value.

- (a) Explain why direct network effects among users might be weaker for LLM platforms compared to social media platforms.

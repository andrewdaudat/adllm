# Fairness in Mechanism Design

## Chapter Introduction

When ChatGPT responds to "What's the best coffee shop near me?" should it favor the highest bidder, the most relevant establishment, or ensure all local coffee shops receive equal consideration? This question strikes at the heart of fairness in AI-powered advertising systems. As these platforms increasingly mediate access to information and economic opportunities, concerns about equitable treatment have moved from philosophical considerations to practical policy requirements.

Consider three coffee shops competing for inclusion in LLM responses: Premium Roasters (established chain with large advertising budget), Local Grind (small neighborhood shop with limited funds), and Student Café (budget-friendly option near campus). A purely revenue-maximizing mechanism consistently features Premium Roasters, potentially undermining local businesses and limiting user choice. Conversely, a rotation system ensuring equal exposure might recommend irrelevant options, reducing user satisfaction.

This scenario illustrates the fundamental tension between efficiency, revenue, and fairness in mechanism design. Unlike traditional economic settings where market forces theoretically ensure fair outcomes, LLM advertising platforms exercise significant control over information access, creating potential for unfair discrimination and market concentration.

Fairness in mechanism design encompasses multiple concepts: procedural fairness (equal treatment in the allocation process), outcome fairness (equitable distribution of benefits), and access fairness (ensuring participation opportunities regardless of economic resources). Each concept leads to different mechanism designs with distinct trade-offs against efficiency and revenue.

**Learning Objectives:** By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

- Distinguish between different fairness concepts (envy-freeness, proportionality, egalitarian, group fairness) and their application to mechanism design
- Understand the mathematical formalization of fairness constraints and their integration with incentive compatibility requirements
- Analyze fairness-efficiency trade-offs and identify conditions where they conflict or align
- Design mechanisms that incorporate fairness considerations while maintaining truthfulness and participation incentives
- Apply fairness analysis to LLM advertising contexts, considering both advertiser equity and user welfare implications

**Chapter Roadmap:** We begin with intuitive examples illustrating different fairness concepts and their potential conflicts with efficiency. The chapter then develops formal mathematical frameworks for fairness in mechanism design, examining both individual and group fairness concepts. We analyze fundamental trade-offs between fairness and other objectives, explore computational approaches for fair mechanism design, and conclude with detailed applications to LLM advertising platforms.

**Connection to Your Thesis Research:** This chapter provides essential foundation for analyzing the fairness dimension of your three-objective (revenue-quality-fairness) framework. The concepts developed here enable you to formally define fairness measures for LLM advertising, design mechanisms that balance fairness against revenue and quality considerations, and analyze the welfare implications of different fairness-efficiency trade-offs.

## Intuitive Development: Understanding Fairness Through Examples

### The School Assignment Problem

To build intuition about fairness concepts, consider assigning students to schools based on preferences and priorities. This classic mechanism design problem illustrates key fairness principles that extend to LLM advertising.

**Students:** Alice (high test scores), Bob (average scores), Carol (low scores, lives near School 1) **Schools:** School 1 (prestigious, limited capacity), School 2 (good quality, moderate capacity), School 3 (basic option, high capacity)

**Mechanism A: Pure Merit-Based** Assign students to their highest-preference school based on test scores.

- Alice → School 1 (high scores, gets first choice)
- Bob → School 2 (moderate scores, gets second choice)
- Carol → School 3 (low scores, gets remaining option)

**Fairness Analysis:**

- **Efficient**: Matches highest achievers with best schools
- **Potentially Unfair**: Systematically disadvantages students with lower test scores, possibly reflecting socioeconomic inequalities rather than merit

**Mechanism B: Lottery System** Random assignment ignoring scores and preferences.

- Equal probability for each student at each school

**Fairness Analysis:**

- **Equal Treatment**: All students have identical chances
- **Inefficient**: Ignores both merit and preferences
- **Process Fair but Outcome Problematic**: May assign unmotivated students to prestigious schools

**Mechanism C: Boston Mechanism** Students rank schools, schools rank students, then stable matching.

- Considers both student preferences and school priorities
- May incentivize strategic reporting (not truthful)

**Mechanism D: Deferred Acceptance** Truthful mechanism respecting both student preferences and school priorities.

- **Strategy-proof**: Truth-telling is optimal
- **Respects Priorities**: Schools' ranking criteria are honored
- **Student-Optimal**: Among stable matchings, favors students

### LLM Advertising Fairness Intuition

**Scenario:** "Recommend a restaurant for dinner tonight" **Advertisers:** Chain Restaurant (high budget), Local Bistro (medium budget), Family Diner (low budget)

**Fairness Concern 1: Economic Discrimination** Should mechanisms favor advertisers based solely on their ability to pay? This could systematically exclude small businesses, reducing diversity and potentially harming users who prefer local options.

**Fairness Concern 2: Relevance vs. Equality** The Chain Restaurant might be less relevant for users seeking unique experiences, but the mechanism could still favor it due to higher bids. This creates a trade-off between user welfare and advertiser equity.

**Fairness Concern 3: Long-term Market Effects** Consistently favoring high-bidding advertisers could lead to market concentration, reducing competition and innovation. Fair mechanisms might consider these dynamic effects.

### Different Fairness Concepts Illustrated

**Individual Fairness: "Similar individuals should be treated similarly"**

- In school assignment: Students with similar test scores should have similar school assignment probabilities
- In LLM advertising: Advertisers with similar relevance scores should have similar selection probabilities, regardless of budget differences

**Group Fairness: "Different groups should receive equitable treatment"**

- In school assignment: Each demographic group should be represented proportionally in prestigious schools
- In LLM advertising: Small businesses should receive adequate representation relative to large corporations

**Procedural Fairness: "The process itself should be fair"**

- In school assignment: All students should be able to participate and have their preferences considered
- In LLM advertising: All advertisers should be able to bid and compete on equal terms

**Outcome Fairness: "The results should be equitably distributed"**

- In school assignment: Educational opportunities should be distributed fairly across students
- In LLM advertising: Advertising opportunities should be distributed fairly across advertisers

**Envy-Freeness: "No agent should prefer another agent's outcome"**

- In school assignment: No student should prefer another student's school assignment given the other student's characteristics
- In LLM advertising: No advertiser should prefer another advertiser's allocation given the other's bid and relevance

### Building Toward Formal Analysis

These examples reveal several key insights:

1. **Multiple Valid Fairness Concepts**: Different fairness notions can conflict with each other and with efficiency
2. **Context Dependence**: Appropriate fairness concepts depend on the specific application and stakeholder concerns
3. **Trade-off Relationships**: Fairness often conflicts with efficiency and revenue, but not always
4. **Strategic Considerations**: Fair mechanisms must still incentivize truthful reporting
5. **Long-term vs. Short-term**: Fair outcomes in individual instances may lead to unfair long-term dynamics

The remainder of this chapter formalizes these concepts mathematically and develops tools for analyzing fairness-efficiency trade-offs in mechanism design.

## Mathematical Foundations: Formal Fairness Concepts

### Individual Fairness in Mechanism Design

**Definition 8.1 (Individual Fairness).** A mechanism satisfies individual fairness if agents with similar characteristics receive similar treatment. Formally, for distance metric $d(\cdot, \cdot)$ on agent types and outcome metric $\rho(\cdot, \cdot)$ on outcomes: $$d(\theta_i, \theta_j) \leq \epsilon \implies \rho(x_i(\theta), x_j(\theta')) \leq L \cdot \epsilon$$ for some Lipschitz constant $L > 0$, where $\theta' = (\theta_j, \theta_{-j})$ and $\theta = (\theta_i, \theta_{-i})$ with $\theta_{-i} = \theta_{-j}$.

**Key Challenge**: Defining appropriate distance metrics for agent characteristics and outcome similarity measures.

**Example - LLM Advertising Individual Fairness:** For advertisers with bids $b_i, b_j$ and relevance scores $r_i, r_j$: $$|(b_i, r_i) - (b_j, r_j)|_2 \leq \epsilon \implies |x_i - x_j| \leq L \cdot \epsilon$$ where $x_i, x_j$ are allocation probabilities.

**Definition 8.2 (Envy-Freeness).** Agent $i$ does not envy agent $j$ if: $$u_i(x_i(\theta), p_i(\theta), \theta_i) \geq u_i(x_j(\theta), p_j(\theta), \theta_i)$$

A mechanism is envy-free if no agent envies any other agent.

**Theorem 8.1 (Envy-Freeness and Efficiency).** In quasilinear environments with private values, the VCG mechanism is envy-free among winning bidders but may not be envy-free overall.

_Proof._ For winning bidders $i, j$ in VCG, payments equal externalities imposed on others. Since allocations are efficient, winner $i$ receives higher surplus than winner $j$ would from $i$'s bundle, eliminating envy. However, losing bidders may envy winners who receive positive surplus. □

### Group Fairness Concepts

**Definition 8.3 (Statistical Parity).** For groups $G_1, G_2 \subseteq N$, a mechanism satisfies statistical parity if: $$\mathbb{E}[x_i \mid i \in G_1] = \mathbb{E}[x_j \mid j \in G_2]$$

**Definition 8.4 (Equalized Odds).** A mechanism satisfies equalized odds across groups if, conditional on agent type $\theta$: $$\mathbb{P}[x_i = 1 \mid \theta_i = \theta, i \in G_1] = \mathbb{P}[x_j = 1 \mid \theta_j = \theta, j \in G_2]$$

**Definition 8.5 (Calibration).** A mechanism is calibrated across groups if for all groups $G$ and allocation probabilities $p$: $$\mathbb{E}[\text{outcome} \mid x_i = p, i \in G] = p$$

**Example - LLM Advertising Group Fairness:** Let $G_1$ = {small businesses}, $G_2$ = {large corporations}. Statistical parity requires: $$\mathbb{E}[\text{ad selection probability} \mid \text{small business}] = \mathbb{E}[\text{ad selection probability} \mid \text{large corporation}]$$

This might conflict with efficiency if large corporations systematically have higher relevance or bid more aggressively.

### Egalitarian and Maximin Fairness

**Definition 8.6 (Egalitarian Mechanism).** A mechanism maximizes the minimum utility across all agents: $$\max_{(x,p) \text{ IC, IR}} \min_{i \in N} \mathbb{E}[u_i(x(\theta), p_i(\theta), \theta_i)]$$

**Definition 8.7 (Proportional Fairness).** An allocation $x$ satisfies proportional fairness if for any alternative allocation $y$: $$\sum_{i \in N} \frac{y_i - x_i}{x_i} \leq 0$$

**Theorem 8.2 (Proportional Fairness Characterization).** An allocation is proportionally fair if and only if it maximizes $\sum_{i \in N} w_i \log x_i$ for some weights $w_i > 0$.

_Proof._ The first-order conditions for maximizing $\sum_i w_i \log x_i$ subject to feasibility constraints yield: $$\frac{w_i}{x_i} = \lambda$$ for some Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$. The proportional fairness condition follows from the envelope theorem applied to small perturbations around this optimum. □

**Connection to Nash Social Welfare:** Proportional fairness with $w_i = 1$ corresponds to maximizing Nash social welfare $\prod_i x_i$.

### Fair Division and Cake Cutting Connections

**Definition 8.8 (Proportionality).** In fair division, agent $i$ receives a proportional share if: $$v_i(\text{bundle}_i) \geq \frac{1}{n} v_i(\text{entire resource})$$

**Definition 8.9 (Envy-Free Division).** A division is envy-free if each agent weakly prefers their own bundle to any other agent's bundle.

**Theorem 8.3 (Existence of Fair Divisions).** For divisible resources with continuous preferences, there always exists an allocation that is both proportional and envy-free.

**Application to LLM Advertising:** Think of "advertising opportunities" as a divisible resource to be allocated fairly among advertisers. Each advertiser should receive a share proportional to their contribution (bid, relevance) while ensuring no advertiser prefers another's allocation.

### Fairness-Efficiency Trade-offs

**Definition 8.10 (Price of Fairness).** The price of fairness is the efficiency loss from imposing fairness constraints: $$\text{PoF} = \frac{\text{Welfare}(\text{efficient allocation})}{\text{Welfare}(\text{fair allocation})}$$

**Theorem 8.4 (Fairness-Efficiency Trade-off).** There exist environments where any envy-free mechanism achieves at most $1/n$ of the efficient welfare, where $n$ is the number of agents.

_Proof Sketch._ Consider agents with values $(n, 0, 0, \ldots, 0)$ for a single item. The efficient allocation gives the item to agent 1. Any envy-free allocation must give each agent probability $1/n$ of receiving the item, achieving welfare $1$ versus efficient welfare $n$. □

**Corollary 8.5 (Impossibility Result).** No mechanism can simultaneously achieve:

1. Allocative efficiency
2. Envy-freeness
3. Individual rationality
4. Strategy-proofness in all environments with heterogeneous valuations.

### Fairness Under Uncertainty

**Definition 8.11 (Ex-Ante vs. Ex-Post Fairness).**

- **Ex-ante fairness**: Fairness in expectation before uncertainty is resolved
- **Ex-post fairness**: Fairness in realized outcomes after uncertainty is resolved

**Theorem 8.6 (Ex-Ante/Ex-Post Trade-off).** Mechanisms that are ex-ante fair may violate ex-post fairness, and vice versa.

_Example._ A lottery giving each agent probability $1/n$ of winning a prize is ex-ante fair but ex-post unfair (winner gets everything, others get nothing).

**Application to LLM Advertising:** Should fairness be measured across all queries (ex-ante) or within each individual query response (ex-post)?

## Advanced Results: Computational Fair Mechanism Design

### Algorithmic Fairness in Mechanism Design

**Definition 8.12 (Computationally Fair Mechanism).** A mechanism is computationally fair if:

1. It can be computed efficiently (polynomial time)
2. It satisfies specified fairness constraints
3. It maintains incentive compatibility and individual rationality

**Theorem 8.7 (Computational Complexity of Fair Mechanisms).** Finding optimal fair mechanisms is NP-hard in general, but polynomial-time approximation algorithms exist for specific fairness concepts.

_Proof Outline._ The general problem reduces to multi-objective optimization with non-convex constraints (IC, IR, fairness). However, for specific fairness measures like proportional fairness, the problem becomes convex and tractable. □

### Approximation Algorithms for Fair Allocation

**Algorithm: Proportionally Fair Allocation**

```
Input: Agent valuations v, fairness weights w
Output: Proportionally fair allocation x

1. Initialize: x_i = 1/n for all i (equal allocation)
2. While not converged:
   3.   For each agent i:
   4.     Compute gradient: g_i = w_i / x_i
   5.     Update: x_i ← x_i + α × (g_i - average(g))
   6.   Project onto feasibility constraints
7. Return x
```

**Theorem 8.8 (Convergence Guarantee).** The proportional fairness algorithm converges to the optimal solution in $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ iterations.

### Machine Learning Approaches to Fair Mechanism Design

**Fairness-Constrained Learning:** $$\min_{(x,p)} \mathbb{E}[\text{loss}(x(\theta), p(\theta), \theta)]$$ $$\text{subject to: IC, IR, fairness constraints}$$

**Implementation via Lagrangian Relaxation:**

```
Algorithm: Fair Mechanism Learning
Input: Training data D, fairness constraints F
Output: Fair mechanism parameters

1. Initialize mechanism parameters θ
2. For each epoch:
   3.   Compute mechanism outputs for batch
   4.   Calculate loss: L = efficiency_loss + λ×fairness_violation
   5.   Update parameters: θ ← θ - α∇L
   6.   Project onto IC/IR constraint set
7. Return final mechanism
```

### Multi-Objective Fair Mechanism Design

**Extended Problem Formulation:** $$\max_{(x,p)} (\text{Efficiency}, \text{Revenue}, \text{Fairness})$$ $$\text{subject to: IC, IR constraints}$$

**Scalarization with Fairness:** $$W_{\lambda,\mu}(x,p) = \lambda_1 \text{Efficiency} + \lambda_2 \text{Revenue} + \mu \text{Fairness}$$

**Theorem 8.9 (Fair Pareto Frontier).** The set of mechanisms that are Pareto efficient in (Efficiency, Revenue, Fairness) space forms a two-dimensional surface in three-dimensional objective space.

### Dynamic Fairness Considerations

**Definition 8.13 (Long-term Fairness).** A dynamic mechanism is long-term fair if fairness violations in individual periods are compensated over time: $$\lim_{T \to \infty} \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T \text{FairnessViolation}_t = 0$$

**Algorithm: Dynamic Fair Allocation**

```
Input: Time horizon T, fairness target F
Output: Allocation sequence {x_t}

1. Initialize fairness debt: debt_i = 0 for all i
2. For each period t:
   3.   Observe agent types θ_t
   4.   Compute efficient allocation x*_t
   5.   Adjust for fairness: x_t = adjust(x*_t, debt)
   6.   Update fairness debt: debt_i += target_allocation_i - x_t,i
7. Return allocation sequence
```

### Robust Fair Mechanisms

**Definition 8.14 (Robust Fairness).** A mechanism is robustly fair if it maintains fairness properties across all realizations in an uncertainty set $\mathcal{U}$: $$\min_{\xi \in \mathcal{U}} \text{Fairness}(x(\xi), p(\xi)) \geq \text{threshold}$$

**Application to LLM Advertising:** Ensure fairness across different user query distributions and advertiser participation patterns.

## Applications and Implementation: Fairness in LLM Advertising

### Problem Formulation: Three-Dimensional Fairness

**Stakeholder-Specific Fairness Concepts:**

**1. Advertiser Fairness:**

- **Individual**: Similar advertisers (bid, relevance) receive similar treatment
- **Group**: Small businesses vs. large corporations receive equitable opportunities
- **Temporal**: Fair distribution of opportunities over time

**2. User Fairness:**

- **Quality Equity**: All users receive high-quality, relevant recommendations
- **Diversity**: Users see diverse advertising content, not just from highest bidders
- **Access**: Equal access to information regardless of advertiser market power

**3. Platform Fairness:**

- **Sustainability**: Fair mechanisms support platform viability
- **Neutrality**: Platform doesn't unfairly favor particular advertiser types

### Mathematical Model for LLM Advertising Fairness

**Setup:**

- Advertisers $N = \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ with types $\theta_i = (v_i, r_i, g_i)$
  - $v_i$: private valuation (willingness to pay)
  - $r_i$: relevance score (known to platform)
  - $g_i$: group membership (small business, large corporation, etc.)

**Fairness Constraints:**

**Individual Fairness:** $$\|(v_i, r_i) - (v_j, r_j)\|_2 \leq \epsilon \implies |x_i - x_j| \leq L\epsilon$$

**Group Fairness (Statistical Parity):** $$\mathbb{E}[x_i \mid g_i = \text{small}] \geq \alpha \cdot \mathbb{E}[x_j \mid g_j = \text{large}]$$ for some fairness parameter $\alpha \in (0, 1]$.

**Temporal Fairness:** $$\frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T x_{i,t} \geq \beta \cdot \frac{1}{T} \sum_{t=1}^T \frac{r_{i,t}}{\sum_j r_{j,t}}$$ ensuring long-term allocation proportional to relevance contributions.

### Fair Mechanism Design for LLM Advertising

**Approach 1: Fairness-Adjusted Scoring** $$\text{Score}_i = \gamma v_i + (1-\gamma) r_i + \phi \cdot \text{FairnessBonus}_i$$

where $\text{FairnessBonus}_i$ depends on:

- Historical under-representation
- Group membership
- Individual fairness violations

**Implementation:**

```
Algorithm: Fair LLM Advertising Mechanism
Input: Query q, Advertisers {(v_i, r_i, g_i)}, Fairness weights φ
Output: Selected advertiser and payment

1. Compute base scores: s_i = γv_i + (1-γ)r_i
2. Calculate fairness adjustments:
   3.   For each advertiser i:
   4.     historical_deficit_i = target_share_i - actual_share_i
   5.     group_adjustment_i = group_fairness_bonus(g_i)
   6.     fairness_bonus_i = φ × (historical_deficit_i + group_adjustment_i)
7. Final scores: score_i = s_i + fairness_bonus_i
8. Select winner: i* = argmax_i score_i
9. Compute payment using fairness-adjusted second-price rule
10. Update historical allocation records
```

**Approach 2: Constrained Optimization** $$\max_{x,p} \alpha \cdot \text{Revenue} + (1-\alpha) \cdot \text{Quality}$$ $$\text{subject to:}$$ $$\text{IC, IR, and fairness constraints}$$

**Approach 3: Multi-Objective with Fairness** $$\max_{x,p} (\text{Revenue}, \text{Quality}, \text{Fairness})$$

Using scalarization: $$W = \lambda_1 R + \lambda_2 Q + \lambda_3 F$$

where $F$ is a fairness measure such as: $$F = -\text{Gini}(\{x_i\}_{i=1}^n) \text{ or } -\sum_i (x_i - \bar{x})^2$$

### Case Study: Fair Book Recommendation System

**Scenario:**

- Query: "Recommend mystery novels"
- Advertisers:
  - MegaBooks: bid=$10, relevance=0.6, group=large_corp
  - LocalReads: bid=$4, relevance=0.8, group=small_business
  - IndiePress: bid=$3, relevance=0.9, group=small_business

**Pure Revenue Mechanism:**

- Winner: MegaBooks
- Revenue: $10, Quality: 0.6, Small Business Share: 0%

**Pure Quality Mechanism:**

- Winner: IndiePress
- Revenue: $3, Quality: 0.9, Small Business Share: 100%

**Fair Balanced Mechanism (with small business promotion):**

```
Fairness-Adjusted Scores:
- MegaBooks: 0.5×10 + 0.5×0.6 + 0×0 = 5.3
- LocalReads: 0.5×4 + 0.5×0.8 + 2×1 = 4.4
- IndiePress: 0.5×3 + 0.5×0.9 + 2×1 = 3.95

Winner: MegaBooks (but closer competition)
```

**Dynamic Fair Mechanism (with temporal adjustment):** If small businesses have been under-represented historically:

```
Historical Deficit Adjustments:
- LocalReads: +3 (significant deficit)
- IndiePress: +2.5 (moderate deficit)

Adjusted Scores:
- MegaBooks: 5.3
- LocalReads: 4.4 + 3 = 7.4
- IndiePress: 3.95 + 2.5 = 6.45

Winner: LocalReads
```

### Quality-Fairness Integration

**Quality Function with Fairness:** $$Q_{\text{fair}}(x,r) = \text{Relevance}(x,r) + \text{Diversity}(x) + \text{UserEquity}$$

**Components:**

- **Relevance**: Standard relevance matching
- **Diversity**: Bonus for showing diverse advertiser types
- **User Equity**: Ensures all user types see appropriate recommendations

**Implementation:**

```
Function: Compute_Fair_Quality(allocation x, relevance r, diversity_bonus δ)
Input: Allocation vector x, Relevance scores r, Diversity parameter δ
Output: Fair quality score

1. base_quality = sum(x[i] × r[i] for i in advertisers)
2. diversity_score = entropy(advertiser_types_in_x)
3. user_equity_score = measure_equal_treatment_across_users()
4. fair_quality = base_quality + δ×diversity_score + user_equity_score
5. Return fair_quality
```

### Empirical Fairness Evaluation Framework

**Metrics for LLM Advertising Fairness:**

**1. Individual Fairness Metrics:**

- **Consistency**: $\text{Corr}(\text{similarity}(\theta_i, \theta_j), \text{similarity}(x_i, x_j))$
- **Lipschitz Constant**: Maximum $|x_i - x_j|/\|\theta_i - \theta_j\|$ across similar agents

**2. Group Fairness Metrics:**

- **Demographic Parity**: $|\mathbb{E}[x \mid G_1] - \mathbb{E}[x \mid G_2]|$
- **Equalized Opportunity**: Allocation rates conditional on relevance levels

**3. Temporal Fairness Metrics:**

- **Long-term Proportionality**: Correlation between cumulative allocation and cumulative contribution
- **Fairness Debt**: Accumulated deviation from fair allocation over time

**Evaluation Algorithm:**

```
Algorithm: Evaluate Fairness of LLM Advertising Mechanism
Input: Mechanism M, Historical data H, Fairness thresholds T
Output: Fairness assessment report

1. For each fairness concept C in {individual, group, temporal}:
   2.   Compute fairness metrics for concept C
   3.   Compare against threshold T[C]
   4.   Identify violations and their severity
5. Analyze fairness-efficiency trade-offs
6. Generate recommendations for mechanism improvement
7. Return comprehensive fairness report
```

2. Establish minimum fairness thresholds
3. Require regular fairness audits and public reporting
4. Create appeals process for fairness violations
5. Balance fairness requirements with efficiency and innovation
```

## Exercises

**Exercise 8.1 (Basic Fairness Concepts)** Consider a single-item auction with three bidders: A (valuation $10), B (valuation $8), C (valuation $6).

a) Design an envy-free mechanism. Is it efficient? b) Design a mechanism that maximizes the minimum utility across bidders. What are the resulting allocations and payments? c) Compare the efficiency of your mechanisms from parts (a) and (b) to the efficient allocation.

**Exercise 8.2 (Individual vs. Group Fairness)** An LLM platform has 6 advertisers: 3 large corporations with bids [$10, $9, $8] and 3 small businesses with bids [$7, $6, $5]. All have identical relevance scores of 0.8.

a) What allocation satisfies individual fairness (similar bidders treated similarly)? b) Design an allocation satisfying group fairness (equal expected allocation rates between groups). c) Can both individual and group fairness be satisfied simultaneously? Explain why or why not.

**Exercise 8.3 (Proportional Fairness in LLM Advertising)** Three advertisers compete for LLM ad placement:

- BookStore: bid = $4, relevance = 0.9
- TechShop: bid = $6, relevance = 0.6
- CoffeePlace: bid = $3, relevance = 0.7

a) Find the proportionally fair allocation that maximizes ∏ᵢ xᵢ subject to ∑ᵢ xᵢ ≤ 1. b) Compare this to the allocation that maximizes total relevance-weighted value ∑ᵢ (bid × relevance)ᵢ × xᵢ. c) Calculate the "price of fairness" - the efficiency loss from using proportional fairness.

**Exercise 8.4 (Dynamic Fairness)** Over 4 time periods, a small business (SmallCorp) and large corporation (BigCorp) compete for ad slots:

Period 1: SmallCorp bid=$3, BigCorp bid=$7 Period 2: SmallCorp bid=$4, BigCorp bid=$6  
Period 3: SmallCorp bid=$2, BigCorp bid=$8 Period 4: SmallCorp bid=$5, BigCorp bid=$5

a) What allocation results from pure revenue maximization each period? b) Design a dynamic mechanism ensuring each advertiser wins exactly 2 periods. c) Calculate total revenue under both approaches. What is the cost of temporal fairness?

**Exercise 8.5 (Multi-Objective Fair Mechanism Design)** Design a mechanism optimizing: W = λ₁×Revenue + λ₂×Quality + λ₃×Fairness

For advertisers with (bid, relevance): A($8, 0.4), B($5, 0.8), C($6, 0.6)

a) Express Revenue, Quality, and Fairness mathematically in terms of allocation probabilities. b) Find optimal allocation for weights (0.5, 0.3, 0.2). c) Find optimal allocation for weights (0.2, 0.3, 0.5). d) Describe how the solution changes as fairness weight increases.

**Exercise 8.6 (Fairness Under Uncertainty)** Advertiser valuations are uncertain: v₁ ~ U[2,6], v₂ ~ U[4,8].

a) Design a mechanism that is ex-ante fair (equal expected allocation probabilities). b) Is your mechanism from (a) ex-post fair for all valuation realizations? c) Design an alternative mechanism that achieves ex-post fairness. What efficiency do you sacrifice?

**Exercise 8.7 (Computational Fair Mechanism)** Implement the fair allocation algorithm:

```
Input: n advertisers with bids bᵢ, relevance rᵢ, fairness weights wᵢ
Output: Fair allocation maximizing ∑ wᵢ log(xᵢ)

Initialize: xᵢ = 1/n for all i
While not converged:
    For each i: compute gradient gᵢ = wᵢ/xᵢ
    Update: xᵢ ← xᵢ + α(gᵢ - ḡ) where ḡ = (1/n)∑gⱼ
    Project onto constraints: ∑xᵢ ≤ 1, xᵢ ≥ 0
```

a) Prove this algorithm converges to the proportionally fair allocation. b) Implement the algorithm and test on a 3-advertiser example. c) How does convergence speed depend on the step size α?

**Exercise 8.8 (Fairness-Efficiency Trade-offs in LLM Context)** An LLM platform serves two user types (budget-conscious, premium) and has two advertiser types (discount, luxury).

a) Define what "user fairness" means in this context. b) Design a mechanism ensuring both user groups see relevant advertisements. c) Analyze the efficiency cost of your fairness constraints. d) Under what conditions might fairness actually improve efficiency?

**Exercise 8.9 (Group Fairness with Intersectionality)** Advertisers belong to multiple groups: {Large/Small} × {Tech/Retail} × {New/Established}.

a) How many distinct groups exist? b) Design fairness constraints ensuring no group is systematically disadvantaged. c) Show that these constraints may conflict with each other. d) Propose a method for resolving conflicting group fairness requirements.

**Exercise 8.10 (Advanced Application: Fair LLM Recommendation Systems)** Design a complete fair mechanism for LLM book recommendations:

a) Define three stakeholder groups and their fairness concerns. b) Formulate the multi-objective optimization problem with fairness constraints. c) Propose a practical algorithm balancing all objectives. d) Design an evaluation framework measuring fairness across different time horizons. e) Discuss regulatory implications of your mechanism design choices.

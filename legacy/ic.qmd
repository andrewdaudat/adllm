# Incentive Compatibility and Truthfulness

## Chapter Introduction

Imagine you're designing an auction for LLM advertising where restaurants bid to be mentioned in responses about dining recommendations. You implement what seems like a reasonable mechanism: advertisers submit bids, and you select winners based on a combination of bid amount and relevance scores. But then you discover something troubling - high-quality restaurants are systematically underbidding, knowing that their superior relevance scores give them an advantage even with lower bids. Meanwhile, less relevant restaurants are overbidding desperately, hoping to compensate for their relevance disadvantage. The mechanism is unraveling because participants are gaming the system rather than revealing their true preferences.

This scenario illustrates why **incentive compatibility** - the property that truth-telling is optimal for participants - is crucial for mechanism design. Without it, even mathematically elegant mechanisms can fail spectacularly in practice. Participants spend resources on strategic manipulation instead of value creation, information revelation becomes unreliable, and optimal allocations become impossible to achieve.

The challenge is particularly acute in LLM advertising because the platform needs accurate information about both advertiser valuations (to maximize revenue) and advertiser relevance (to maintain quality), but advertisers have strong incentives to misrepresent both. Classical auction theory provides powerful tools for addressing these challenges, but they must be carefully adapted to the multi-dimensional, quality-dependent context of AI-powered advertising.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will:

- Master the mathematical foundations of incentive compatibility in both dominant strategy and Bayesian settings
- Understand how to apply the taxation principle and Myerson's lemma to derive optimal payment rules
- Analyze the fundamental trade-offs between information rent extraction and participation incentives
- Design truthful mechanisms for multi-dimensional problems like LLM advertising
- Recognize when and why incentive compatibility constraints limit mechanism performance

### Chapter Roadmap and LLM Relevance

This chapter develops incentive compatibility theory through four interconnected sections. We begin with dominant strategy concepts that provide the strongest truth-telling guarantees, then extend to Bayesian settings where strategic behavior depends on beliefs about others. The taxation principle and Myerson's lemma provide computational tools for deriving payment rules that maintain truthfulness. Finally, we tackle multi-dimensional mechanism design - directly relevant to LLM advertising where advertisers have private information about both valuations and quality.

The progression builds toward your thesis research on multi-objective LLM advertising mechanisms. Understanding how to maintain truthfulness while balancing revenue and quality objectives is essential for designing practical mechanisms that work reliably at scale. The mathematical tools developed here will be crucial for characterizing feasible mechanisms and proving their strategic properties.

## Dominant Strategy Incentive Compatibility: The Gold Standard

### Definition and Fundamental Properties

The strongest form of incentive compatibility ensures that truth-telling is optimal regardless of what other participants do or believe.

**Definition 3.1 (Dominant Strategy Incentive Compatibility)** A mechanism $M = (f, t)$ is **dominant strategy incentive compatible (DSIC)** if for every agent $i$, every possible type $\theta_i \in \Theta_i$, every possible report $\theta_i' \in \Theta_i$, and every possible reports by others $\theta_{-i} \in \Theta_{-i}$:

$$u_i(\theta_i, f(\theta_i, \theta_{-i}), t_i(\theta_i, \theta_{-i})) \geq u_i(\theta_i, f(\theta_i', \theta_{-i}), t_i(\theta_i', \theta_{-i}))$$

where $u_i$ represents agent $i$'s utility function.

**Economic Interpretation**: No matter what others do, truth-telling maximizes your expected utility. This is an extremely strong requirement that greatly simplifies strategic analysis and implementation.

**Example - LLM Restaurant Auction**: Consider three restaurants bidding for mention in response to "best Italian restaurants downtown":

- **Bella Vista**: True valuation $v_1 = 80$, relevance $r_1 = 0.9$
- **Giuseppe's**: True valuation $v_2 = 60$, relevance $r_2 = 0.7$
- **Pizza Corner**: True valuation $v_3 = 100$, relevance $r_3 = 0.4$

A DSIC mechanism ensures that Bella Vista's optimal strategy is to report $(\hat{v}_1, \hat{r}_1) = (80, 0.9)$ regardless of what Giuseppe's and Pizza Corner report. This predictability is invaluable for platform design.

### The Revelation Principle: Focusing on Truthful Mechanisms

One of the most powerful results in mechanism design shows we can restrict attention to truthful mechanisms without loss.

**Theorem 3.2 (Revelation Principle)** For any mechanism $M$ and any equilibrium of $M$, there exists a truthful mechanism $M'$ that yields the same outcome for every possible type profile and gives every agent at least as much utility.

_Proof_: Let $s^*(\theta)$ be an equilibrium strategy profile in mechanism $M$. Define the direct mechanism $M' = (f', t')$ by:

- $f'(\theta) = f(s^*(\theta))$
- $t'(\theta) = t(s^*(\theta))$

Since $s^*$ was optimal in $M$, we have for all $i, \theta_i, \theta_i'$: $$u_i(\theta_i, f(s^*(\theta_i, s^*_{-i}(\theta_{-i}))), t_i(s^*(\theta_i, s^*_{-i}(\theta_{-i})))) \geq u_i(\theta_i, f(s^*(\theta_i', s^*_{-i}(\theta_{-i}))), t_i(s^*(\theta_i', s^*_{-i}(\theta_{-i}))))$$

Substituting the definitions of $f'$ and $t'$: $$u_i(\theta_i, f'(\theta_i, \theta_{-i}), t'_i(\theta_i, \theta_{-i})) \geq u_i(\theta_i, f'(\theta_i', \theta_{-i}), t'_i(\theta_i', \theta_{-i}))$$

Therefore, truth-telling is optimal in $M'$. □

**Practical Significance**: This result means platform designers can focus exclusively on direct, truthful mechanisms without worrying about complex indirect mechanisms or strategic equilibria.

### Monotonicity: The Key to Implementability

Not every social choice function can be implemented by a DSIC mechanism. The key constraint is **monotonicity**.

**Definition 3.3 (Monotonicity)** An allocation rule $f$ is **monotonic** if for every agent $i$ and every $\theta_{-i}$: $$\theta_i > \theta_i' \implies f_i(\theta_i, \theta_{-i}) \geq f_i(\theta_i', \theta_{-i})$$

**Economic Interpretation**: Higher types should have weakly higher allocation probabilities. This ensures that higher-value agents don't want to misrepresent as lower-value types.

**Theorem 3.4 (Characterization of DSIC)** An allocation rule $f$ can be implemented in dominant strategies if and only if it is monotonic.

_Proof Sketch_:

- **Necessity**: If $f$ is DSIC but not monotonic, there exist types $\theta_i > \theta_i'$ such that $f_i(\theta_i, \theta_{-i}) < f_i(\theta_i', \theta_{-i})$ for some $\theta_{-i}$. But then type $\theta_i$ would prefer to report $\theta_i'$, contradicting DSIC.

- **Sufficiency**: Given monotonic $f$, construct payments using the taxation principle (developed below). The resulting mechanism will be DSIC. □

### LLM Advertising Application: Multi-Dimensional Monotonicity

In LLM advertising, advertisers have multi-dimensional types: $(v_i, r_i)$ where $v_i$ is valuation and $r_i$ is relevance. Monotonicity becomes more complex.

**Definition 3.5 (Multi-Dimensional Monotonicity)** An allocation rule $f(v, r)$ is monotonic if:

1. $\frac{\partial f_i}{\partial v_i} \geq 0$ (higher valuations increase allocation probability)
2. $\frac{\partial f_i}{\partial r_i} \geq 0$ (higher relevance increases allocation probability)
3. Cross-derivatives satisfy appropriate conditions for path-independence

**Example Implementation**: For the weighted scoring mechanism $s_i = \alpha v_i + (1-\alpha) r_i$, monotonicity is satisfied when $\alpha, (1-\alpha) > 0$, ensuring that increases in either dimension improve allocation probability.

## Bayesian Nash Incentive Compatibility: Strategic Interdependence

### When Dominant Strategies Are Too Restrictive

While DSIC provides the strongest incentive guarantees, it significantly limits the set of implementable mechanisms. Many natural and efficient mechanisms only satisfy the weaker **Bayesian Nash incentive compatibility (BNIC)** condition.

**Definition 3.6 (Bayesian Nash Incentive Compatibility)** A mechanism $M = (f, t)$ is **Bayesian Nash incentive compatible** if for every agent $i$ and every type $\theta_i$:

$$\mathbb{E}_{\theta_{-i}}\left[ u_i(\theta_i, f(\theta_i, \theta_{-i}), t_i(\theta_i, \theta_{-i})) \right] \geq \mathbb{E}_{\theta_{-i}}\left[ u_i(\theta_i, f(\theta_i', \theta_{-i}), t_i(\theta_i', \theta_{-i})) \right]$$

for all possible misreports $\theta_i'$, where the expectation is taken over the distribution of other agents' types.

**Key Difference from DSIC**: Truth-telling is optimal _on average_ given beliefs about others' types, but may not be optimal for every specific realization of others' types.

### First-Price Auctions: A BNIC Example

First-price sealed-bid auctions provide a classic example of BNIC mechanisms that are not DSIC.

**Strategic Environment**:

- $n$ bidders with valuations $v_i \sim F$ independently
- Highest bidder wins and pays their bid
- Symmetric equilibrium: $b(v) = \mathbb{E}[\max_{j \neq i} v_j | \max_{j \neq i} v_j \leq v]$

**BNIC Property**: Given others use equilibrium strategy $b(\cdot)$, bidding $b(v_i)$ when your valuation is $v_i$ maximizes expected utility.

**Not DSIC**: If you knew others would bid very low, you'd want to deviate from $b(v_i)$ and bid lower yourself.

**LLM Advertising Relevance**: First-price mechanisms might be appropriate for LLM advertising when the platform wants to encourage competitive bidding while maintaining some quality considerations through bid shading.

### Revenue Equivalence in Bayesian Settings

The revenue equivalence principle extends to Bayesian settings with important implications for LLM advertising mechanism design.

**Theorem 3.7 (Bayesian Revenue Equivalence)** Consider two BNIC mechanisms with identical allocation rules. If both mechanisms give the same expected utility to the lowest type of each agent, then they generate identical expected revenue.

_Proof Idea_: The expected payment difference between mechanisms must come from information rents. But if allocation rules and lowest-type utilities are identical, these rents are uniquely determined. □

**Platform Design Implication**: Revenue considerations alone cannot distinguish between many mechanism designs. The choice should be based on other factors like computational complexity, robustness, or multi-objective trade-offs.

### Optimal Bayesian Mechanisms

Myerson's celebrated result characterizes revenue-optimal mechanisms in Bayesian settings.

**Virtual Valuation Transform**: $$\psi_i(v_i) = v_i - \frac{1 - F_i(v_i)}{f_i(v_i)}$$

where $F_i$ and $f_i$ are the CDF and PDF of bidder $i$'s valuation distribution.

**Theorem 3.8 (Myerson's Optimal Auction)** The revenue-maximizing BNIC mechanism:

1. Allocates to the bidder with the highest non-negative virtual valuation
2. Charges payments that make the mechanism BNIC
3. Sets reserve prices where virtual valuations equal zero

**LLM Advertising Extension**: For multi-dimensional types $(v_i, r_i)$, the virtual valuation becomes: $$\psi_i(v_i, r_i) = v_i - \frac{1 - F_i(v_i | r_i)}{f_i(v_i | r_i)}$$ where the distribution of valuations may depend on relevance levels.

## The Taxation Principle and Payment Rules

### Deriving Payments from Allocations

Once we have a monotonic allocation rule, the **taxation principle** provides a systematic method for constructing payments that ensure truthfulness.

**Theorem 3.9 (Taxation Principle)** Given a monotonic allocation rule $f$, there exists a payment rule $t$ such that $(f, t)$ is DSIC. The payment for agent $i$ with type $\theta_i$ is:

$$t_i(\theta_i, \theta_{-i}) = \theta_i f_i(\theta_i, \theta_{-i}) - \int_{\underline{\theta_i}}^{\theta_i} f_i(s, \theta_{-i}) ds - U_i(\underline{\theta_i}, \theta_{-i})$$

where $\underline{\theta_i}$ is the lowest possible type and $U_i(\underline{\theta_i}, \theta_{-i})$ is the utility of the lowest type (often set to zero for individual rationality).

_Proof_: The payment rule ensures that the envelope theorem is satisfied - an agent's utility changes with their type only through the direct effect on their allocation, not through strategic considerations. □

**Economic Interpretation**: The payment consists of three components:

1. **Value of allocation**: $\theta_i f_i(\theta_i, \theta_{-i})$
2. **Information rent**: $-\int_{\underline{\theta_i}}^{\theta_i} f_i(s, \theta_{-i}) ds$
3. **Participation adjustment**: $-U_i(\underline{\theta_i}, \theta_{-i})$

### Myerson's Lemma: A Computational Tool

Myerson's lemma provides a more computationally tractable approach to deriving payments.

**Theorem 3.10 (Myerson's Lemma)** If allocation rule $f$ is monotonic and differentiable, then the unique DSIC payment rule (up to constants) is:

$$t_i(\theta_i, \theta_{-i}) = \theta_i f_i(\theta_i, \theta_{-i}) - \int_{\underline{\theta_i}}^{\theta_i} \frac{\partial f_i(s, \theta_{-i})}{\partial s} s \, ds$$

**Computational Advantage**: This formula directly uses the derivative of the allocation rule, making it easier to implement in practice.

### Application to LLM Advertising Mechanisms

Let's apply these tools to design a truthful mechanism for LLM advertising.

**Setup**:

- Allocation rule: $f_i(v_i, r_i, v_{-i}, r_{-i}) = \mathbb{P}(\text{advertiser } i \text{ is selected})$
- Scoring function: $s_i = \alpha v_i + (1-\alpha) r_i$ (assumed monotonic in both dimensions)

**Payment Derivation**: Using Myerson's lemma for the valuation dimension: $$t_i^v = v_i \frac{\partial f_i}{\partial v_i} - \int_{\underline{v_i}}^{v_i} \frac{\partial^2 f_i}{\partial s \partial v_i} s \, ds$$

**Simplified Implementation**: For discrete mechanisms where advertiser $i$ wins if $s_i = \max_j s_j$, the payment becomes: $$t_i = \frac{\max_{j \neq i} s_j - (1-\alpha) r_i}{\alpha}$$

This ensures that the advertiser pays just enough to maintain their winning position, adjusted for their relevance advantage.

**Example Calculation**:

- Winner: $s_i = 0.6 \times 80 + 0.4 \times 0.9 = 48.36$
- Runner-up: $s_j = 0.6 \times 60 + 0.4 \times 0.7 = 36.28$
- Payment: $t_i = \frac{36.28 - 0.4 \times 0.9}{0.6} = \frac{36.28 - 0.36}{0.6} = 59.87$

## Multi-Dimensional Mechanism Design

### The Challenge of Multiple Private Attributes

LLM advertising naturally involves multi-dimensional types where advertisers have private information about both their valuations and their quality/relevance. This creates significantly more complex incentive constraints.

**Multi-Dimensional Type Space**: $\theta_i = (v_i, q_i)$ where:

- $v_i \in [0, \bar{v}]$: Private valuation for being mentioned
- $q_i \in [0, 1]$: Private quality/relevance score

**Incentive Compatibility Constraints**: For every possible type $\theta_i = (v_i, q_i)$ and every possible misreport $\theta_i' = (v_i', q_i')$:

$$u_i((v_i, q_i), f(\theta_i, \theta_{-i}), t_i(\theta_i, \theta_{-i})) \geq u_i((v_i, q_i), f(\theta_i', \theta_{-i}), t_i(\theta_i', \theta_{-i}))$$

**Complexity**: Instead of a single monotonicity constraint, we now need:

- $\frac{\partial f_i}{\partial v_i} \geq 0$ (valuation monotonicity)
- $\frac{\partial f_i}{\partial q_i} \geq 0$ (quality monotonicity)
- Cross-derivative conditions for path-independence

### Impossibility Results and Limitations

Multi-dimensional mechanism design faces fundamental limitations not present in single-dimensional settings.

**Theorem 3.11 (Multi-Dimensional Impossibility)** In general multi-dimensional settings, there may not exist any DSIC mechanism that is simultaneously:

1. Efficient (allocates to highest-value bidders)
2. Revenue-maximizing
3. Individually rational

_Intuition_: With multiple dimensions of private information, the constraints for maintaining truthfulness become so restrictive that natural objectives cannot be simultaneously achieved.

**LLM Advertising Implication**: Perfect optimization of both revenue and quality while maintaining truthfulness may be impossible. Mechanism designers must make trade-offs.

### Practical Design Approaches

Despite theoretical limitations, several practical approaches work well for multi-dimensional LLM advertising mechanisms.

**Approach 1: Linear Scoring with Constrained Payments** $$s_i = \alpha v_i + (1-\alpha) q_i$$

$$
t_i = \begin{cases}
\frac{\max_{j \neq i} s_j - (1-\alpha)q_i}{\alpha} & \text{if } i \text{ wins} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$

**Approach 2: Separate Auctions with Cross-Constraints**

- Run valuation auction subject to minimum quality threshold
- Quality scores determine eligibility but not payment
- Maintains simplicity while incorporating quality considerations

**Approach 3: Menu-Based Mechanisms** Offer advertisers a menu of contracts $(allocation\_probability, payment)$ and let them self-select:

- High-quality, high-value advertisers choose high-allocation, high-payment contracts
- Lower types choose correspondingly lower contracts
- Achieves separation while maintaining some truthfulness properties

### Implementation Example: Multi-Dimensional LLM Auction

```python
class MultiDimensionalLLMAuction:
    def __init__(self, alpha=0.6, quality_threshold=0.3):
        self.alpha = alpha
        self.quality_threshold = quality_threshold

    def compute_scores(self, advertisers):
        """Compute allocation scores with quality filtering"""
        eligible = [a for a in advertisers if a.quality >= self.quality_threshold]
        scores = [(a, self.alpha * a.bid + (1-self.alpha) * a.quality)
                 for a in eligible]
        return sorted(scores, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

    def compute_payment(self, winner, runner_up_score):
        """Apply multi-dimensional payment formula"""
        if runner_up_score is None:
            return 0  # No competition

        # Payment adjusts for quality advantage
        payment = (runner_up_score - (1-self.alpha) * winner.quality) / self.alpha
        return max(0, payment)  # Ensure non-negative

    def run_auction(self, advertisers):
        """Execute multi-dimensional auction"""
        scored = self.compute_scores(advertisers)

        if not scored:
            return None, 0

        winner, winner_score = scored[0]
        runner_up_score = scored[1][1] if len(scored) > 1 else 0

        payment = self.compute_payment(winner, runner_up_score)

        return winner, payment
```

This implementation demonstrates how theoretical multi-dimensional mechanism design translates into practical algorithms for LLM advertising platforms.

## Individual Rationality and Participation Constraints

### Ensuring Voluntary Participation

Even truthful mechanisms fail if participants choose not to participate. **Individual rationality (IR)** ensures that participation is always beneficial.

**Definition 3.12 (Individual Rationality)** A mechanism $(f, t)$ is individually rational if for every agent $i$ and every type profile $\theta$:

$$u_i(\theta_i, f(\theta), t_i(\theta)) \geq 0$$

**Economic Interpretation**: No one is worse off participating in the mechanism than staying out entirely.

### Ex-Post vs. Ex-Ante Individual Rationality

Different IR concepts provide different guarantees:

**Ex-Post IR**: Participation is beneficial for every type realization $$u_i(\theta_i, f(\theta), t_i(\theta)) \geq 0 \text{ for all } \theta$$

**Ex-Ante IR**: Participation is beneficial in expectation $$\mathbb{E}_{\theta}\left[ u_i(\theta_i, f(\theta), t_i(\theta)) \right] \geq 0$$

**Interim IR**: Participation is beneficial given agent's own type $$\mathbb{E}_{\theta_{-i}}\left[ u_i(\theta_i, f(\theta_i, \theta_{-i}), t_i(\theta_i, \theta_{-i})) \right] \geq 0$$

**LLM Platform Choice**: Ex-post IR is strongest but most restrictive. For competitive advertising markets, interim IR may provide the right balance between participation guarantees and mechanism flexibility.

### Revenue-Participation Trade-offs

There's often a fundamental tension between extracting revenue and ensuring participation.

**Theorem 3.13 (Participation-Revenue Trade-off)** In optimal auctions, increasing reserve prices raises revenue from participating bidders but reduces participation rates. The optimal trade-off depends on the distribution of bidder valuations.

**LLM Advertising Application**: Platforms must balance:

- **High reserves**: More revenue per advertiser, but fewer advertisers participate
- **Low reserves**: Broad participation, but lower revenue extraction
- **Quality thresholds**: Ensure response quality, but may exclude willing advertisers

### Implementation Strategies

**Strategy 1: Graduated Entry Fees**

- Low entry fee ensures broad participation
- Revenue extraction occurs through auction payments
- Particularly effective when advertiser valuations are uncertain

**Strategy 2: Performance-Based Participation**

- Free entry but payments depend on realized performance (clicks, conversions)
- Aligns platform and advertiser incentives
- Requires sophisticated measurement infrastructure

**Strategy 3: Long-term Relationship Building**

- Accept lower short-term revenue to build advertiser base
- Use reputation systems to reward consistent quality advertisers
- Particularly relevant for LLM platforms building market share

## Applications and Implementation

### Case Study 1: Search Advertising Truthfulness

Google's AdWords system provides real-world insights into incentive compatibility challenges and solutions.

**Historical Evolution**:

- **Early System**: Pure first-price auction based only on bids
- **Problem**: Low-quality ads with high bids dominated results
- **Solution**: Quality Score integration creating effective second-price mechanism

**Current Mechanism Structure**: $$\text{Ad Rank} = \text{Bid} \times \text{Quality Score}$$ $$\text{Price} = \frac{\text{Next Highest Ad Rank}}{\text{Quality Score}}$$

**Truthfulness Properties**:

- Bidding more increases allocation probability (monotonic in bid)
- Improving quality increases allocation probability (monotonic in quality)
- Payment structure incentivizes both higher bids and better ad quality

**Lessons for LLM Advertising**: The success of quality-adjusted pricing in search advertising suggests similar approaches could work for LLM advertising, where content integration quality is crucial for user experience.

### Case Study 2: Multi-Unit Spectrum Auctions

The FCC's spectrum auctions demonstrate large-scale implementation of complex truthful mechanisms with high stakes.

**Mechanism Design Challenge**:

- Multiple licenses (units) available
- Bidders have complex complementarity and substitution preferences
- Billions of dollars at stake requiring robust truthfulness properties

**Solution: Simultaneous Ascending Auction (SAA)**:

- Multiple rounds of bidding on different licenses
- Information revelation through price discovery process
- Truthful bidding as approximately optimal strategy

**Performance Results**:

- Raised over $100 billion in spectrum license sales
- Generally efficient allocation to highest-value users
- Few major strategic gaming incidents

**LLM Platform Insights**:

- Multi-round mechanisms can handle complex preference structures
- Price discovery helps both platforms and advertisers learn market values
- Robust truthfulness properties scale to high-value, high-stakes environments

### Case Study 3: Combinatorial Exchange Implementation

Several platforms have implemented combinatorial mechanisms for complex allocation problems with multiple interdependent items.

**Example: Display Advertising Exchanges**

- Advertisers bid on packages of ad slots across websites
- Publishers offer bundles of advertising inventory
- Two-sided matching with complex preferences

**Mechanism Structure**:

1. **Package Bidding**: Advertisers submit bids on desired combinations
2. **Optimization**: Platform solves winner determination problem
3. **VCG Payments**: Truth-telling incentives maintained through externality pricing

**Implementation Challenges**:

- Computational complexity of winner determination
- Communication complexity of eliciting complex preferences
- Strategic complexity for participants with limited computational resources

**LLM Advertising Relevance**: As LLM advertising matures, advertisers may value complex combinations:

- Mentions across multiple related queries
- Specific positioning within responses
- Coordination with other advertisers for complementary mentions

### Practical Implementation Framework

Based on these case studies, here's a practical framework for implementing truthful LLM advertising mechanisms:

```python
class TruthfulLLMMechanism:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.alpha = config.get('revenue_weight', 0.6)
        self.quality_threshold = config.get('min_quality', 0.3)
        self.reserve_price = config.get('reserve_price', 0)

    def validate_monotonicity(self, allocation_function):
        """Test that allocation rule satisfies monotonicity"""
        # Implementation would test various valuation/quality combinations
        # to ensure higher types get higher allocation probabilities
        pass

    def compute_payments(self, allocation_result, advertisers):
        """Apply taxation principle to derive truthful payments"""
        payments = {}

        for winner_id, allocation_prob in allocation_result.items():
            if allocation_prob > 0:
                # Find marginal contribution using Myerson's lemma
                without_winner = self.run_allocation([a for a in advertisers
                                                   if a.id != winner_id])
                marginal_value = allocation_result.total_value - without_winner.total_value

                # Payment equals externality imposed on others
                payments[winner_id] = marginal_value

        return payments

    def verify_incentive_compatibility(self, mechanism_results):
        """Post-hoc verification that truthfulness was maintained"""
        # Statistical tests for strategic behavior
        # Comparison of reported vs. revealed preferences
        # Detection of systematic misreporting patterns
        pass
```

This framework demonstrates how theoretical incentive compatibility concepts translate into practical implementation and monitoring systems.

### Connections to LLM Advertising Research

The incentive compatibility framework developed here directly enables your thesis research in several ways:

**Multi-Objective Mechanism Design**: Understanding how truthfulness constraints limit the achievable Pareto frontier between revenue and quality objectives.

**Quality-Dependent Mechanisms**: Extending classical results to settings where advertiser payments depend on ex-post quality measurements of content integration.

**Dynamic Learning**: Analyzing how incentive properties change when platforms learn about advertiser quality over time through performance feedback.

### Bridge to Advanced Topics

**Chapter 4 (Revenue Optimization)** will build on the payment rule derivations developed here to characterize revenue-optimal mechanisms under different assumptions about advertiser type distributions.

**Chapter 7 (Multi-Objective Mechanism Design)** will use the multi-dimensional framework established here to analyze trade-offs between competing objectives in LLM advertising.

**Chapter 13 (Multi-Objective LLM Advertising Mechanisms)** will directly apply these theoretical tools to design and analyze practical mechanisms for AI-powered advertising platforms.

The mathematical foundations established in this chapter - monotonicity conditions, payment rule derivations, and multi-dimensional analysis - provide essential tools for tackling the advanced challenges in your thesis research on multi-objective mechanism design for LLM advertising markets.

## Exercises

### Exercise 3.1: DSIC Verification

Consider a simple LLM advertising mechanism where two advertisers compete for a single mention slot. The mechanism selects the advertiser with the highest score $s_i = 0.7 \cdot v_i + 0.3 \cdot r_i$, where $v_i$ is the reported valuation and $r_i$ is the (observable) relevance score. The winner pays the minimum bid needed to maintain their winning score.

Given:

- Advertiser 1: true valuation $v_1 = 100$, relevance $r_1 = 0.8$
- Advertiser 2: true valuation $v_2 = 80$, relevance $r_2 = 0.6$

a) Calculate the outcome when both advertisers report truthfully. b) Check whether Advertiser 1 has any incentive to underreport their valuation to $v_1' = 90$. c) Verify that the allocation rule satisfies monotonicity in valuations.

### Exercise 3.2: Payment Rule Derivation

For the allocation rule $f_i(v_i) = \mathbb{P}(v_i \geq \max_{j \neq i} v_j)$ in a symmetric setting with valuations uniformly distributed on $[0,1]$:

a) Derive the explicit formula for $f_i(v_i)$ when there are $n$ total bidders. b) Use Myerson's lemma to calculate the payment rule $t_i(v_i)$. c) Verify that the resulting mechanism satisfies individual rationality.

### Exercise 3.3: Multi-Dimensional Design

Consider an LLM advertising mechanism where advertisers have two-dimensional types $(v_i, q_i)$ representing valuation and quality. The platform wants to implement the allocation rule:

$$f_i(v_i, q_i) = \mathbb{P}(\alpha v_i + (1-\alpha) q_i \geq \max_{j \neq i} (\alpha v_j + (1-\alpha) q_j))$$

a) Prove that this allocation rule satisfies monotonicity in both dimensions. b) Derive the payment rule using the taxation principle, assuming quality is observable but valuations are private. c) Show that if quality were also private information, additional constraints would be needed for implementability.

### Exercise 3.4: Revenue-Participation Trade-off

An LLM platform is considering different reserve price policies for their advertising auction:

- Policy A: No reserve price (all advertisers can participate)
- Policy B: Reserve price of $r = 50$ (only advertisers with $v_i \geq 50$ participate)

Assume advertiser valuations are uniformly distributed on $[0, 100]$ and there are 3 potential advertisers.

a) Calculate expected revenue under each policy. b) Determine the reserve price that maximizes expected revenue. c) Analyze how the optimal reserve price changes if advertiser valuations are exponentially distributed with rate $\lambda = 0.02$.

### Exercise 3.5: Computational Implementation

Implement a truthful mechanism for the following LLM advertising scenario:

**Setup**: 5 advertisers compete for up to 2 mention slots in restaurant recommendations. Each advertiser has:

- Private valuation $v_i$ for any mention
- Observable relevance score $r_i$
- Utility function $u_i = v_i \cdot x_i - t_i$ where $x_i$ is probability of being mentioned

**Requirements**: a) Design an allocation rule that considers both bids and relevance scores. b) Implement the payment rule using Myerson's lemma. c) Write code to verify DSIC property through simulation. d) Test with sample data: valuations $[80, 60, 90, 70, 85]$, relevance scores $[0.9, 0.7, 0.6, 0.8, 0.75]$.

### Exercise 3.6: Incentive Compatibility Analysis

Consider the segment auction mechanism from the main LLM advertising paper where scores are computed as $s_i = q_i b_i e^{\epsilon_i}$ with Gumbel noise.

a) Prove that this mechanism is truthful by showing it's a randomization over second-price auctions. b) Calculate the expected payment formula and verify it matches the result from Myerson's lemma. c) Analyze how the addition of Gumbel noise affects the incentive properties compared to a deterministic highest-score mechanism.
